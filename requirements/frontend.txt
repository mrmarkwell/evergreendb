Notes:
1. remember interface should be multilingual!
2. Need way to store variables for use between pages, might need to use IPC and store in main process instead of render process (or find another way)

login:
can enter username and password then submit/load another screen
Saves the username and password (in memory only) for use in REST calls from other pages. (note2)

query/child selection:
dynamic table, columns and rows not hard coded
way to select which columns are displayed
way to filter (using filter REST endpoint) and see currently applied filters.
(optional?) advanced filter button to allow direct sql queries (maybe also add some way to make table joins easier?)
easy way to select multiple children
next button to go to main page and pass selcted children (using note2 or maybe using url query variables)

child view:
tabbed interface with data for a child
when data is changed a save button is enabled that puts changes
list of children (that were selected in query) that when clicked 
  a) warns unsaved changes will be lost if applicable with cancel and discard options 
  b) loads/displays selected child's data and stays in current tab (or goes to main tab if you thin that's better instead)
new child button that behaves similarly to selecting a child but empties all fields and somehow knows to post instead of put when save is clicked

settings/management:
language select! Though maybe this is better in the login screen?
(optional) change password
reset password (admins only)
add/remove users (admins only)

todo/flagged:
show list of flagged notes
clicking on one goes to notes tab of child view with that note/child
(optional) clicking on one instead shows full text of note and child name to one side and clicking on child name goes to notes tab of child view
